1. Create a simple Card game, where we can shuffle a deck of card and Deal a single card
 
   Solution:

		import random

# Take cards as an object

class Card(object):
    def __init__(self, suit, val):
        self.suit = suit
        self.val = val

    def show(self):
        print("{} of {}". format(self.val, self.suit))

# This is Deck of cards 

class Deck(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        self.build()
        
    # Different types of cards
    
    def build(self):
        for s in ["Spades", "clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts"]:
            for v in range(1, 14):
                self.cards.append(Card(s, v))

    # It will show the cards
    
    def show(self):
        for c in self.cards:
            c.show()
    
    # This will shuffle the cards
    
    def shuffle(self):
        for i in range(len(self.cards)-1, 0, -1):
            r = random.randint(0, i)
            self.cards[i], self.cards[r] = self.cards[r], self.cards[i]
    
    # In this function it will take out the random cards
    
    def draw(self):
        return self.cards.pop()


deck = Deck()
deck.shuffle()

card = deck.draw()
card.show()



2.  Write a Python program which has two methods get_String and print_String. get_String accept a string from the user and print_String print the string in Title case

Solution:

class IOString():
    def __init__(self):
        self.str1 = ""

    def get_String(self):
        self.str1 = input("please enter something")

    def print_String(self):
        print(self.str1.upper())

str1 = IOString()
str1.get_String()
str1.print_String()

3. Write a Python program named Circle, initialize it with radius and two methods which will compute the area and the perimeter of a circle.

Solution:

class Circle():
    def __init__(self, r):
        self.radius = r

    def area(self):
        return self.radius**2*3.14
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2*self.radius*3.14

NewCircle = Circle(8)
print(NewCircle.area())
print(NewCircle.perimeter())


4. Create a python progra for a Movie Database. You can store movies in a data structure like Dictionary or list.
The program should be menu based and used should be able to select option to 
	1) list all movies
	2) Search for a movie
	3) Add a movie
	4) Delete a movie
	
solution:

	lis = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 8]

print(lis)

print('List has the items: ', lis)
searchItem = int(input('Enter a number to search for: '))
found = False
for i in range(len(lis)):
    if lis[i] == searchItem:
        found = True
        print(searchItem, ' was found in the list at index ', i)
        break
if found == False:
    print(searchItem, ' was not found in the list!')

print(f'Current Numbers List {lis}')

num = int(input("Please enter a number to add to list:\n"))

index = int(input(f'Please enter the index between 0 and {len(lis) - 1} to add the number:\n'))

lis.insert(index, num)

print(f'Updated Numbers List {lis}')

# using pop() to delete element at pos 2
# deletes 3
lis.pop(2)

# displaying list after popping
print("List elements after popping are : ", end="")
for i in range(0, len(lis)):
    print(lis[i], end=" ")


#You should handle exceptions in all the above programs.
